## 🗝️ Key Languages

⚡I am interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in windows programming. However, I am interested in hardware descriptions languages like Verilog as well. On the other hand, I also do low level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly. Eventhough not my strong point, I'm also capable of working with web development tools. 

```

## 💡Highlight Projects

⚡These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 💻 Eight Bit Computer Using FPGA
In this project I followed (https://github.com/asankaSovis/eight_bit_computer) github project and try to learned about FPGA and iverilog programming.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 𓇲 HDL
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [eight_bit_computer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/eight_bit_computer)




### 02. 📚 Project Akaradiya
Building a database of Sinhala definitions for an English dictionary using crowd sourcing. Anyone can create an account using their email. They can later add words to the dictionary, add definitions to the existing words, vote for the best definition from currently existing definitions that others have added.In this project i take a part to develop in frontend design.
- *Key Technologies* - ⌨️ JavaScript | 📱 HTML | 🐘 PHP | 🎨 CSS
- *Status* - ✅ done
